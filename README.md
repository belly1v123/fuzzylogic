# Fuzzy Logic
Fuzzy logic is a form of multi-valued logic that deals with reasoning that is approximate rather than fixed and exact. Unlike classical logic where variables may only be true or false, fuzzy logic variables may have a truth value that ranges between 0 and 1. This makes it suitable for applications like control systems and decision-making processes where precise mathematical models are difficult to derive.

## Input Variables
The system uses two input variables:

1) Soil Moisture: Represents the moisture level in the soil. It ranges from 0 to 100.
2) Temperature: Represents the ambient temperature. It ranges from 0 to 40.

## Fuzzify the Input Variables
Fuzzification is the process of transforming crisp input values into fuzzy values based on predefined membership functions.

## Soil Moisture
1) Dry: Represented by a triangular membership function.
2) Ideal: Represented by a triangular membership function.
3) Wet: Represented by a triangular membership function.

## Temperature
1) Cold: Represented by a triangular membership function.
2)  Warm: Represented by a triangular membership function.
3) Hot: Represented by a triangular membership function.

## Define Fuzzy Rules
Fuzzy rules define the relationship between input fuzzy variables and the output fuzzy variable. The rules for this system are:

1) If soil moisture is dry and temperature is cold, then irrigation is medium.
2) If soil moisture is dry and temperature is warm, then irrigation is high.
3) If soil moisture is dry and temperature is hot, then irrigation is high.
4) If soil moisture is ideal and temperature is cold, then irrigation is low.
5) If soil moisture is ideal and temperature is warm, then irrigation is medium.
6) If soil moisture is ideal and temperature is hot, then irrigation is medium.
7) If soil moisture is wet and temperature is cold, then irrigation is low.
8) If soil moisture is wet and temperature is warm, then irrigation is low.
9) If soil moisture is wet and temperature is hot, then irrigation is low.

## Inference Engine
The inference engine applies the fuzzy rules to the input fuzzy variables to generate fuzzy outputs. This involves:

1) Evaluating the rules based on the input values.
2) Combining the results of the rules to form a fuzzy output.

## Defuzzification
Defuzzification is the process of converting the fuzzy output into a crisp value. In this system, we use the centroid method to obtain the crisp irrigation level.

## Implementation Considerations
1) Ensure the input sensors for soil moisture and temperature provide accurate readings.
2) Calibrate the membership functions based on real-world observations and experiments.
3) The system should be tested under various environmental conditions to ensure its robustness.
